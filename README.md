# File-IO-With-Binary-Trees
This repo will contain two projects: The first one, which is already added, is a User Built Decision Tree where the user can interactively build a decision tree. The second project, to be added later, will be a general-purpose Binary Search Tree. The main purpose of these projects is to study file I/O in C++ both can be saved and loaded from files.
